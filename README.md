# ChatGPT_based_on_Local_PDF
I have used the langchain library for making the ChatGPT like Chatbot for asking questions based on the PDF on a local Storage and with the help of the OpenAI API to give response based on the GPT3 large language model. 

The process likely involves several steps:

PDF Parsing: You would need to extract the text from the PDF document. This can be done using libraries such as PyPDF2 or pdfminer.

Input Processing: Once the text is extracted, you would preprocess it to clean and format the data. This may involve removing unwanted characters, handling line breaks, or performing any necessary text normalization.

Communication with the OpenAI API: You would need to establish a connection to the OpenAI API using the appropriate authentication credentials. This allows you to send requests and receive responses from the GPT-3 model.

Generating Questions: Based on the content of the PDF, you would formulate questions to ask the chatbot. These questions can be designed to seek specific information or clarify certain points.

Sending Requests: You would send the prepared questions as input to the GPT-3 model via the OpenAI API. The model processes the input and generates a response.

Receiving and Formatting Responses: Once the response is received from the GPT-3 model, you would extract the relevant information and format it for presentation to the user. This could involve extracting specific sentences or segments of text from the generated response.

Displaying the Response: Finally, you would display the response to the user through an interface or any other means you've implemented.

By combining the capabilities of the langchain library, which likely provides tools for building conversational agents, and the OpenAI API, which allows access to the powerful GPT-3 model, you can create a chatbot that can interact with users, process questions based on the content of a PDF, and generate responses using natural language generation.
